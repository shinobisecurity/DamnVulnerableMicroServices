#Damn Vulnerable Microservices (DVMS)

Damn Vulnerable Microservices (DVMS) is microservices that is damn vulnerable with no exception. These project goals are designed to learn about OWASP TOP 10 API Security risks. So, you can demonstrate your skill to exploiting and protecting against Kubernetes Microservices.

## Warning
Damn Vulnerable Microservice (DVMS) is very damn vulnerable! Do not use it as reference on how to build good microservices on your production server. I recommend use it in local environment to prevent unauthorized attacker exploiting your valuable server.

## Disclaimer

We have given warnings and taken measures to prevent users from installing DVMS on to live web servers.
